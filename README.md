### Hi Neighbors,

I'm Jeff

I'm in my mid 60's and a few years into retirement living. 

40 years ago, while pursueing an Associates Degree in Industrial Electronics I took a semester of Microprocessors 101 
and learned the basics of machine language programming. The Commodore 64 and Apple 2 were hot stuff, and me along with most of the world had not even 
the remotest idea of the impact computers would have in our lives.

I see learning to code as a great way to keep my mind active and challenged as the years & miles begin to 
be felt and a slower lifestyle reluctently becomes more necessary. For now its a hobby and like 40 years ago I have no idea of where 
it will lead.  

Reach out to me here: jeff4449@icloud.com

Jeff
